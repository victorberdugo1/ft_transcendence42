# Enuma Fighter — ft_transcendence

## Description

**Enuma Fighter** is a real-time multiplayer brawler game built as a full-stack web application, created as the final project of the 42 Common Core.

Up to 8 players connect simultaneously and fight in live matches. The game supports 1v1 duels, multi-player free-for-all sessions, and structured tournaments with a single-elimination bracket. Spectators can watch any ongoing match in real time. A full social layer — friends, direct chat, notifications, and profiles — runs alongside the game.

**Key features:**
- Web-based brawler ("Enuma Fighter") built with Raylib compiled to WebAssembly
- Real-time multiplayer via WebSocket — 60 Hz authoritative server loop
- 4 playable characters (Eldwin, Hilda, Quimbur, Gabriel) with distinct stats and move sets
- Tournament system with single-elimination bracket
- Spectator mode (overflow + voluntary)
- Friends system, direct chat, and in-app notifications
- Achievements, XP/level progression, and leaderboard
- React frontend + Express backend + PostgreSQL database
- Fully containerized with Docker — single command to run

- **Meetings:** weekly sync to review progress and resolve blockers
- **Communication:** WhatsApp — dedicated group and general coordination

---

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- GNU Make
- Latest stable Google Chrome (or Firefox / Safari / Edge)

### Setup and run

```bash
make
```

On first run this takes approximately 15 minutes (compiles Raylib to WASM, builds all images, starts all containers).

If `.env` does not exist, `make` creates it automatically from `.env.example` — no manual setup required.

Open **https://localhost:8443** in your browser and accept the self-signed certificate.

> To use custom credentials or ports, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, edit it, then run `make`.

### Make commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make` | First-time setup + full build + start |
| `make wasm` | Recompiles `main.c` to WASM only, then restarts |
| `make up` | Starts all containers without rebuilding |
| `make dev` | Starts with logs in the terminal (Ctrl+C to stop) |
| `make re` | Stops + recompiles WASM + restarts |
| `make logs` | Streams logs from all services |
| `make logs-<service>` | Streams logs from a specific service |
| `make shell-<service>` | Opens a shell inside a container |
| `make down` | Stops all containers |
| `make clean` | Full reset — removes all images and volumes |

---

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 (Vite) | Component model, fast HMR, large ecosystem |
| Game engine | Raylib → WebAssembly via Emscripten | Proven 2D engine, runs in-browser with no plugins |
| Backend | Express (Node.js) | Lightweight, straightforward WebSocket integration |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational schema, strong consistency, `pg` driver |
| Real-time | WebSocket (`ws` library) | Full-duplex, low latency, native browser support |
| Proxy / TLS | nginx | TLS termination, static file serving, reverse proxy |
| Containerization | Docker Compose | Single-command deployment, reproducible environment |
| Auth | bcrypt + opaque session tokens | Secure password hashing, cookie-based sessions |

| Multiplayer 3+ players | Major | 2 | vberdugo | Sessions support up to 8 simultaneous players; authoritative server handles sync and fair scoring. |
| AI Opponent | Major | 2 | vberdugo | game/ai.js — heuristic bot with randomized reaction delays injecting synthetic inputs every tick. |
| Game customization (characters + abilities) | Minor | 1 | vberdugo + isegura- | 4 selectable characters with distinct stats and abilities; character selection and customization UI integrated into the frontend flow. |
| Gamification (achievements + XP + leaderboard) | Minor | 1 | aprenafe | Server-side achievements, XP/level in user_stats, top-10 leaderboard — all persisted in PostgreSQL. |
| Game statistics and match history | Minor | 1 | aprenafe | Per-user wins, losses, streaks in user_stats; full match log in matches; displayed on the profile page. |
| GDPR compliance | Minor | 1 | mmarinov | Endpoints to export all personal data (JSON) and permanently delete an account, accessible from the profile. |
| Multiple browser support | Minor | 1 | aprenafe + isegura- | Full feature parity tested on Firefox, Safari, and Edge; browser-specific UI and layout fixes documented. |
| Spectator mode | Minor | 1 | vberdugo | Overflow and voluntary spectators receive live state broadcasts without sending input. |
| Tournament system | Minor | 1 | isegura- | Single-elimination bracket system with automatic progression, dynamic bracket rendering, and responsive tournament visualization. |

**Total: 19 points** (14 mandatory + 5 bonus)

## Individual Contributions

### aprenafe — Project Manager + Developer
- `game/achievements.js`: server-side detection and granting of achievements (`first_win`, `veteran` — more to be added)
- `game/stats.js`: win streak, best streak, and match duration tracking
- `social/chat.js`: direct messaging backend — storage, retrieval, read-flag management
- `social/notifications.js`: notification creation, delivery, and all social event triggers
- React pages: `Achievements.jsx`, `Chat.jsx`, `Leaderboard.jsx`, `Notifications.jsx`
- Multi-browser support: tested and documented on Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Team coordination: weekly syncs, GitHub Issues board, unblocked cross-module dependencies
- **Challenge:** Achievements needed to fire after every match without slowing the game loop. Solved by running checks asynchronously after the match is committed to the database.

### isegura- — Developer
- `Login.jsx` and `Register.jsx`: auth forms with client-side validation (format, length, required fields)
- `Tournament.jsx`: dynamic single-elimination bracket, recursive layout for any power-of-two participant count
- `Privacy.jsx` and `Terms.jsx`: policy pages accessible from the footer on every page
- nginx: HTTPS configuration with automatic self-signed certificate generation at container startup
- Frontend form validation across all user-facing forms
- `.env.example`: all environment variables documented with safe defaults
- **Challenge:** Rendering the bracket dynamically for 4, 8, or 16 participants required a recursive tree layout. Solved with a bracket-builder utility that computes positions and bye slots from the player count.

### mmarinov — Technical Lead + Developer
- `social/friends.js`: friends backend — send/accept/block, online status
- `social/profile.js`: profile backend — avatar upload, stats aggregation, match history
- GDPR endpoints: personal data export (JSON) and permanent account deletion with cascade
- React pages: `Friends.jsx`, `Game.jsx`, `Home.jsx`, `Notifications.jsx`, `Profile.jsx`
- Architecture decisions: service boundaries, REST contract, database schema ownership, code review standards
- **Challenge:** Profile page needed data from four tables without N+1 queries. Solved with a single JOIN query fetching everything in one round trip.

### vberdugo — Product Owner + Developer
- Game engine: Raylib → WASM, `main.c`, authoritative physics loop at 60 Hz
- WebSocket server: connection lifecycle, input frames, state broadcasting, reconnection (`ws/handler.js`)
- Session management: 1v1, free-for-all (3–8 players), spectator routing (`game/session.js`)
- 4 playable characters with distinct stats, voltage system, hitstop, combo detection
- Auth system: register, login, logout, bcrypt, opaque session cookies (`auth.js`)
- Remote players, multiplayer 3+ support, tournament backend
- AI Opponent (`game/ai.js`): heuristic bot with randomized reaction delays
- **Challenge:** Syncing state across 8 WebSocket clients at 60 Hz required minimizing payload size. Solved by profiling and switching to a flat JSON structure that reduced parsing time on the client.
